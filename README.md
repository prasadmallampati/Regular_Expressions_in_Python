Regular expressions



A regular expression (or RE) specifies a set of strings that matches it; the functions in this module let you check if a particular string matches a given regular expression (or if a given regular expression matches a particular string, which comes down to the same thing).

Module Contents

The module defines several functions, constants, and an exception. Some of the functions are simplified versions of the full featured methods for compiled regular expressions. Most non*trivial applications always use the compiled form.

Simple Patterns

We’ll start by learning about the simplest possible regular expressions. Since regular expressions are used to operate on strings, we’ll begin with the most common task: matching characters.

For a detailed explanation of the computer science underlying regular expressions (deterministic and non-deterministic finite automata in flat subject), you can refer to almost any textbook on writing compilers.


In various fields, including computer science, mathematics, and philosophy, the terms "deterministic" and "non*deterministic" have specific meanings:















Here’s a complete list of the meta characters; their meanings will be discussed in the rest of this HOWTO.

. ^ $ * + ? { } [ ] \ | ( )


Here are some examples for each of the special characters you mentioned in regular expressions:

  ^ : Start of the string. Example: ^hello matches "hello" only at the beginning of a string.

  $ : End of the string. Example: world$ matches "world" only at the end of a string.

  * : Zero or more occurrences. Example: a* matches "", "a", "aa", "aaa", etc.

  + : One or more occurrences. Example: a+ matches "a", "aa", "aaa", etc., but not an empty string.

  ? : Zero or one occurrence. Example: a? matches "" or "a".

  {} : Exact number of occurrences. Example: a{3} matches exactly "aaa".
	
  [] : Character class. Example: [abc] matches any single character "a", "b", or "c".

  \ : Escape character. Example: \w matches a word character (alphanumeric plus underscore).

  | : Alternation. Example: a|b matches either "a" or "b".

  () : Capturing group. Example: (ab)+ matches one or more occurrences of "ab".

Some examples of using these special characters together:

  ^hello|world$ matches strings that start with "hello" or end with "world".

  [a- zA-Z]+ matches one or more letters (both lowercase and uppercase).

 \d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2} matches a date in the format "YYYY-MM-DD".

Remember, regular expressions can be very powerful and flexible, but also complex. If you have a specific use case or question, feel free to ask!




































Functions in regular expressions


1. re.search(pattern, string):
    - Searches for the first occurrence of the pattern in the string.
    - Returns a match object if found, otherwise returns None.
    - The match object contains information about the match, such as the starting and ending positions of the match.
2. re.match(pattern, string):
    - Matches the pattern at the beginning of the string.
    - Returns a match object if the pattern matches the start of the string, otherwise returns None.
    - Similar to re.search, but only matches at the start of the string.
3. re.findall(pattern, string):
    - Finds all occurrences of the pattern in the string.
    - Returns a list of strings, where each string is a match of the pattern.
    - Useful for extracting multiple matches from a string.
4. re.sub(pattern, repl, string):
    - Replaces occurrences of the pattern in the string with the repl string.
    - Returns the modified string with the replacements made.
    - Useful for replacing text in a string.
5. re.compile(pattern):
    - Compiles a regular expression pattern into a regular expression object.
    - Returns a regex object that can be used for matching, searching, and replacing.
    - Useful for pre-compiling a regular expression pattern for repeated use.
